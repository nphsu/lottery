# Lottery Game
The lottery using a Blockchain.

# Preparation
You should install a MetaMask and a Ganache to use this app. (It will be unnecessary to prepare a Ganache in the future. It has only local mode now.)

[MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)

[Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache)

And also, you must set up a NPM to launch this frontend application.
